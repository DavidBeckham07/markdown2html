# Hello World using Java Programming.
Just to give you a little excitement about Java programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional C Programming Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.
```
public class MyFirstJavaProgram {

   /* This is my first java program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    */

   public static void main(String []args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
   }
}
```

# Why to Learn java Programming?
Java is a **MUST** for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in *Software Development Domain*. I will list down some of the *key advantages* of learning Java Programming:

1. **Simple**
Java is designed to be *easy to learn*. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to *master*.

2. **Robust**
Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on *compile time error* checking and runtime checking.

3. **Object Oriented**
	1. In Java, everything is an *Object*. 
	2. Java can be easily *extended* since it is based on the Object model.

4. **Secure**
	1. With Java's secure feature it enables to develop *virus-free*, *tamper-free* systems. 
	2. Authentication techniques are based on *public-key encryption*.

# Applications of Java Programming

> The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.
> The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.

## Multithreaded
With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.

## High Performance
With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.

## Audience
This tutorial has been prepared for the beginners to help them understand the basic to advanced concepts related to Java Programming language.
